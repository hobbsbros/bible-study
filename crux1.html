<div class='title'>Who am I?</div>
<div class='discussion'>Who am I?  Why do I exist?</div>
<div class='discussion'>These are among the most important questions we face in our lives.  And they point us towards the most important truth about human existence.</div>
<div class='discussion'>For answers, we will turn to God's Word.  In its very first chapter, the Bible makes an amazing claim about the purpose of human existence.  The first chapter of the Bible is titled "Genesis", which means "beginnings".</div>

<div class='discussion'>What does this verse tell us about humanity?  What does it mean to be created in the image and likeness of God?</div>
<div class='discussion'>In order to determine the meaning of this expression, we will consider the larger context.  Doing so will allow us to understand how the term "image and likeness" is used in other settings.  The next time the Bible uses the phrase "image and likeness" is in the fifth chapter of Genesis.</div>

<div class='discussion'>What was the devil's strategy when he was tempting Eve?  How does his line of questioning lead Eve away from the truth?</div>
<div class='discussion'>What was Eve's response to the devil?  How does her response depart from the truth?</div>
<div class='discussion'>Notice how the devil calls God a liar, saying that instead Eve "will not die."  Not only does he seeks to get her to break a rule, he wants Eve to damage her relationship with God.</div>
